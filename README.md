- 👋 Hi, I’m @plagroen
- 👀 I’m interested in all kinds of stuff. I used to be a software engineer (VB6, Java, Oracle) over 20 years ago.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning Flask. Just out of curiosity/for fun.
- 💞️ I’m not really looking to collaborate on anything, you don't want me touching your projects anymore.
- 📫 How to reach me ...
